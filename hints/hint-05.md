Now that we've identified which mock objects are being used in this method,
let's identify which methods are being called of these objects. Again trace
through the `getMarketValue` method in the source code and try to identify the
methods being called of the types we've mocked.

HINT: [I've read through the `getMarketValue` method and I still don't know
which method(s) are being called on the mock object(s)!](hints/hint-06.md)
